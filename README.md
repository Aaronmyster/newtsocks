Newtsocks
=========

It's an anagram for news and stocks.

This is a small project I'm doing to figure out if there's a correlation between public opinion of companies and their stock prices. I'm blogging about it here: [beardedcoder.blogspot.com](http://beardedcoder.blogspot.com/2014/08/data-mining-news-and-stock-market.html)

Requirements
------------
* sqlite: apt-get install sqlite3
* virtualenv: pip install virtualenv (not sure if you actually need this)

Instructions:
-------------
1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Aaronmyster/newtsocks.git
2. cd into the directory: cd newtsocks
3. Get into the virtual environment: source bin/activate

... Still working on the rest
